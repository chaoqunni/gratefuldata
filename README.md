# Grateful Data
Welcome to Grateful Data. Grateful Data isn't programming code (per se), but an online tutorial about data acquisition, cleaning and enriching, using publicly accessible data on the band [the Grateful Dead](https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead) as examples.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need a program called Refine. If you don't already have it, I would recommend downloading and installing version 2.5; released  in 2011 (when it was still called Google Refine), version 2.5 is currently the stable version. A beta version of 2.6 (branded as Open Refine) is available on GitHub but has not been updated since 2013.

*[Windows kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.zip) (Download, unzip, and double-click on google-refine.exe. If you’re having issues with the above, try double-clicking on refine.bat instead.)

*[Mac kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.dmg) (Download, open, drag icon into the Applications folder and double click on it. NOTE: If you have issues installing Refine on Mac, please refer to issue 590 - Google Refine 2.5 for mac support java 6 and 7 only.)

*[Linux kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.tar.gz) (Download, extract, then type ./refine to start. NOTE: Google Refine 2.5 for linux support java 6 and 7 only.)

Once Refine is installed on your machine, click on the *DOWNLOAD ZIP* button to save the practice data locally. Then click the [Wiki] (https://github.com/scottythered/gratefuldata/wiki) link at the top of the page to jump right in.

## A Note About Licensing

More information is available [here] (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), but the short version is treat it like a tape-trader: share and share alike, but not for commercial purposes, and always with  appropriate credit. If you want to build on what I've done, fantastic, but only under the same license.

## A Note About Data Licenses
With the growth of publicly-available datasets, the research data community -- including [Harvard’s Dataverse] (http://best-practices.dataverse.org/harvard-policies/community-norms.html), [Figshare] (http://figshare.com/licensing), and [Dryad] (http://www.datadryad.org/pages/faq#deposit) -- recommends [CC0] (https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0/), or "No Rights Reserved", for data and database licensing, especially scientific data. However, this is not always the case, so always be sure to check the terms of use for any data you acquire.

Grateful Data uses sample data culled from the Internet Archive and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) ACE Repertory Search. The Internet Archive's [terms of use] (https://archive.org/about/terms.php) clearly state that access to their data is granted for scholarship and research purposes; however, ASCAP's terms of service state:

>ASCAP owns all rights, title and interest in and to its ACE Repertory Search, and any copyrights, database rights and/or other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights therein. Information from ACE may be downloaded, reproduced and/or used solely for evaluation purposes (either for your own benefit or the benefit of a third party for whom you are providing legal, accounting or other professional services) and may not be sold, offered for sale, marketed, promoted, advertised, commercialized or used as the basis to create derivative works, directly or indirectly, in any manner. By accessing ACE, you acknowledge and agree that you shall comply, and take steps to ensure that any third party for whom you are providing legal, accounting or other professional services in connection with information obtained from ACE agrees to comply, with the above ACE Terms of Use and any additional terms and conditions that we provide to you in connection with ACE and other products and services we may offer or make available to you.

Because of this, I will provide instructions on how to acquire ASCAP's data, but will not make the data available on this Git.
