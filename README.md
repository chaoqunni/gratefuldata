# Grateful Data
Welcome to Grateful Data. Grateful Data isn't programming code (per se), but an online tutorial about data acquisition, cleaning and enriching, using publicly accessible data on the band the Grateful Dead as examples.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need a program called Refine. If you don't already have it, I would recommend downloading and installing version 2.5; released  in 2011 (when it was still called Google Refine), version 2.5 is currently the stable version. A beta version of 2.6 (branded as Open Refine) is available on GitHub but has not been updated since 2013.

[Windows kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.zip) (Download, unzip, and double-click on google-refine.exe. If youâ€™re having issues with the above, try double-clicking on refine.bat instead.)

[Mac kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.dmg) (Download, open, drag icon into the Applications folder and double click on it. NOTE: If you have issues installing Refine on Mac, please refer to issue 590 - Google Refine 2.5 for mac support java 6 and 7 only.)

[Linux kit] (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.tar.gz) (Download, extract, then type ./refine to start. NOTE: Google Refine 2.5 for linux support java 6 and 7 only.)

Once Refine is installed on your machine, click the WIKI link at the top of the page to jump in.
